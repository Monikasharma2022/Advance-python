    "# Exception processing is a critical aspect of software development, particularly in handling unexpected or exceptional situations that may arise during program execution. Here are three common applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Error Handling in Software Applications:\n",
    "# Exception processing is extensively used in software applications to handle errors and exceptional conditions gracefully. Some common scenarios include:\n",
    "# Input validation: Checking user inputs for correctness and raising exceptions if invalid data is provided. For example, validating user input in a web form to ensure it meets specific criteria (e.g., email addresses, passwords).\n",
    "# Resource management: Ensuring proper cleanup of resources (such as file handles, database connections, network sockets) in case of errors or exceptions. Using exception handling constructs like try-except-finally blocks ensures that resources are properly released, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "# External dependencies: Dealing with errors that may arise when interacting with external systems or services (e.g., databases, APIs, web services). Exception handling allows applications to handle connection failures, timeouts, or other unexpected responses gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fault Tolerance in Distributed Systems:\n",
    "# In distributed systems, exception processing is crucial for achieving fault tolerance and ensuring system reliability. Some common applications include:\n",
    "# Retry strategies: Implementing retry logic to handle transient faults that may occur due to network issues, temporary unavailability of services, or resource contention. Exceptions raised during communication with remote services can trigger automatic retries with backoff strategies to mitigate transient failures.\n",
    "# Circuit breakers: Using circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures and overload situations in distributed systems. Exception processing is used to monitor the health of remote services and open or close circuit breakers based on error rates or failure thresholds.\n",
    "# Graceful degradation: Designing systems to gracefully degrade functionality in the face of failures or degraded performance. Exception handling mechanisms allow applications to degrade non-essential features or fallback to alternative strategies when critical components are unavailable or underperforming.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transaction Management in Database Systems:\n",
    "# Exception processing is fundamental to ensuring data integrity and consistency in database transactions. Some key applications include:\n",
    "# ACID properties: Enforcing Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties of transactions. Exception handling ensures that transactions are rolled back in case of errors or exceptions, preventing partial updates and maintaining database consistency.\n",
    "# Savepoints and rollback: Using savepoints and rollback operations to handle nested transactions and partial rollbacks within larger transactions. Exceptions raised during transaction execution can trigger rollback to a savepoint or the beginning of the transaction to maintain a consistent database state.\n",
    "# Conflict resolution: Handling concurrency conflicts and transaction aborts due to conflicts with other concurrent transactions. Exception processing allows applications to detect and resolve conflicts (e.g., using optimistic concurrency control or pessimistic locking) to ensure data integrity in multi-user environments."

    "# If an exception occurs in a program and it is not handled appropriately, several potential consequences may arise:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Program Termination: If an exception is not caught and handled within the program, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top-level scope of the program. If the exception remains unhandled at this point, the program will terminate abruptly. This can result in an error message being displayed to the user or the program crashing without warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loss of Data or Inconsistent State: If an exception occurs during the execution of critical operations, such as file I/O, database transactions, or network communications, and it is not properly handled, it may lead to data loss or corruption. For example, if a file is being written and an exception occurs before the file is closed properly, data may be lost or the file may be left in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resource Leakage: Failure to handle exceptions can lead to resource leakage, where resources such as file handles, database connections, or network sockets are not properly released. This can result in the exhaustion of system resources over time, leading to degraded performance or system instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Security Vulnerabilities: Unhandled exceptions can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in a program. For example, if an exception reveals sensitive information, such as stack traces or error messages, it could be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the inner workings of the program or to launch attacks against the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# User Frustration: From a user perspective, encountering unhandled exceptions can be frustrating and confusing. Instead of receiving informative error messages or experiencing graceful degradation of functionality, users may encounter cryptic error messages or experience unexpected program behavior, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction."

    "# Raise Statement:\n",
    "# The raise statement is used to explicitly raise an exception at any point in the code. You can raise built-in exceptions provided by Python or define custom exception classes for specific error conditions.\n",

    "# if x < 0:\n",
    "#     raise ValueError(\"Value must be non-negative\")\n",

    "#     print(\"Custom error:\", e)\n",
    "# The raise statement allows you to specify the type of exception and an optional error message or other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# AssertionError:\n",
    "# The assert statement is used to raise an AssertionError exception if a condition specified in the assertion evaluates to False. Assertions are typically used to check for conditions that should always be true during program execution.\n",

    "#     return x / y\n",
    "\n",

    "# In Python, you can specify actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists, using the finally block and the atexit module. Here's how each method works:\n",

    "\n",
    "# atexit Module:\n",
