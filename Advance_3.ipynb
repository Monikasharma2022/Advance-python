    "# An abstract superclass, also known as an abstract base class (ABC), is a class in object-oriented programming that serves as a blueprint for other classes but is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, it provides a common interface and possibly some default implementations that subclasses can inherit and specialize.\n",
    "# Key concepts of an abstract superclass include:\n",
    "# Cannot be Instantiated: An abstract superclass cannot be instantiated on its own. Attempting to create an instance of an abstract superclass directly will result in an error. Instead, it serves as a template for creating subclasses.\n",
    "# Defines Abstract Methods: An abstract superclass typically defines one or more abstract methods. These methods are declared in the superclass but do not contain any implementation details. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
    "# Provides a Common Interface: An abstract superclass may define a set of methods that represent a common interface shared by all its subclasses. This common interface allows subclasses to be treated uniformly, promoting polymorphism and code reuse.\n",
    "# May Contain Concrete Methods: In addition to abstract methods, an abstract superclass may also contain concrete (implemented) methods. These methods provide default behavior that subclasses can inherit. Subclasses have the option to override these methods to provide custom behavior.\n",
    "# Promotes Code Reuse and Polymorphism: By defining common behavior in an abstract superclass, you can promote code reuse across multiple subclasses. Additionally, abstract superclasses facilitate polymorphism, allowing objects of different subclasses to be treated interchangeably.\n",
    "# In languages like Python, abstract superclasses are typically implemented using the abc module, which provides tools for defining abstract base classes and abstract methods. By subclassing ABC (or using the @abstractmethod decorator), you can define abstract superclasses and enforce subclass implementations of abstract methods."
