    "A metaclass in Python is a class of a class. In other words, it's the class used to instantiate classes. Every class in Python is an instance of a metaclass. By default, the metaclass of a class is the type metaclass, but you can define custom metaclasses to customize the behavior of classes.\n",
    "Here are some key points about metaclasses:\n",
    "Class Creation:\n",
    "When you define a class in Python, the Python interpreter instantiates a new class object. This class object is created by the metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizing Class Creation:\n",
    "Metaclasses allow you to customize how classes are created and behave.\n",
    "You can define custom behavior for class creation, initialization, attribute access, and more by implementing special methods in the metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaclass Inheritance:\n",
    "Just like classes can inherit from other classes, metaclasses can inherit from other metaclasses. This allows for a hierarchy of metaclasses with different behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "Metaclasses are often used for:\n",
    "Implementing design patterns like singleton pattern.\n",
    "Enforcing coding standards and conventions.\n",
    "Adding additional functionality to classes automatically.\n",
    "Implementing domain-specific language (DSL) syntax.\n",
    "Creating frameworks or libraries with declarative syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Metaclasses:\n",
    "You define a metaclass by subclassing an existing metaclass (usually type) and implementing special methods like __new__ or __init__.\n",
    "These special methods control how the class object is created and initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyMeta(type):\n",
    "    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n",
    "        print(\"Creating class:\", name)\n",
    "        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Initializing MyClass\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "MyMeta is a custom metaclass inheriting from the built-in type metaclass.\n",
    "The __new__ method in MyMeta is called when the MyClass class is created, allowing you to customize class creation.\n",
    "When MyClass is defined, the MyMeta.__new__ method is invoked, printing \"Creating class: MyClass\".\n",
    "Finally, when an instance of MyClass is created, the __init__ method of MyClass is called.\n",
    "Metaclasses are an advanced feature of Python and are typically used in scenarios where you need to dynamically alter the behavior of classes at runtime. They can be powerful but should be used judiciously as they can make code harder to understand and maintain."

    "The best way to declare a class's metaclass depends on your specific requirements and the complexity of your design. However, there are a few common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify Metaclass Directly:\n",
    "You can specify the metaclass directly in the class definition using the metaclass keyword argument.\n",
    "This approach is straightforward and explicit, making it clear which metaclass is used for the class.\n",
    "class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Metaclass in Base Class:\n",

    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass(BaseClass):\n",

    "\n",
    "Define Metaclass in a Separate Module:\n",
    "If the metaclass implementation is complex or needs to be reused across multiple classes or modules, you can define it in a separate module and then import it where needed.\n",

    "class MyMeta(type):\n",

    "from metaclass_module import MyMeta\n",
    "class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Metaclass Selection:\n",
    "You can dynamically select the metaclass based on certain conditions or runtime parameters.\n",
    "This approach allows for more flexibility in choosing different metaclasses for different scenarios.\n",
    "def choose_metaclass():\n",
    "    if condition:\n",

    "Class decorators and metaclasses are both advanced features in Python for modifying or enhancing the behavior of classes, but they operate at different stages of class creation and offer different levels of customization. Here's how they overlap and differ:\n",
