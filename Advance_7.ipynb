    "\n",
    "# except Blocks:\n",

    "# In Python, the two most popular variations of the try statement involve using except blocks to catch exceptions and the optional finally block for cleanup actions. These variations provide flexibility in handling exceptions and ensuring that necessary cleanup tasks are performed. Here are the two most popular try statement variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try-Except Blocks:\n",
    "# The try-except block is the fundamental variation of the try statement, used to catch and handle exceptions that may occur within a block of code. It allows you to specify one or more except blocks to handle different types of exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# try:\n",
    "#     # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "# except SomeException:\n",
    "#     # Handle the exception\n",
    "# except AnotherException:\n",
    "#     # Handle a different type of exception\n",
    "# In this variation, each except block catches and handles exceptions of a specific type. If an exception occurs within the try block, Python will search for a matching except block and execute the corresponding code to handle the exception. If no matching except block is found, the exception will propagate to the surrounding code or be caught by an outer try statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try-Finally Blocks:\n",
    "# The try-finally block is used to ensure that certain cleanup actions are always performed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. The code within the finally block is executed after the try block, even if an exception is raised, providing a reliable way to release resources or perform finalization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# try:\n",
    "#     # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "# finally:\n",
    "#     # Cleanup or finalization code\n",
    "# In this variation, the finally block contains cleanup or finalization code that should always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs within the try block. This ensures that resources are properly released and cleanup actions are performed, improving the reliability and robustness of the code."

    "# The raise statement in Python is used to explicitly raise an exception. Its primary purpose is to signal that an error or exceptional condition has occurred within a program, allowing developers to handle the error gracefully and provide appropriate error messages or responses.\n",
    "# Triggering Exceptions:\n",
    "# The primary purpose of the raise statement is to trigger or raise exceptions explicitly within a Python program. You can raise built-in exceptions provided by Python or define custom exception classes for specific error conditions.\n",
    "# if x < 0:\n",
    "#     raise ValueError(\"Value must be non-negative\")\n",

    "#     raise CustomError(\"An error occurred in some_function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Providing Contextual Information:\n",
    "# When raising exceptions, the raise statement allows developers to provide additional contextual information or error messages to help with debugging and error handling. This information can be included as part of the exception object being raised.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# def divide(x, y):\n",
    "#     if y == 0:\n",
    "#         raise ValueError(\"Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",

    "\n",
    "# Error Propagation:\n",
    "# By raising exceptions at appropriate points in the code, the raise statement facilitates error propagation, allowing exceptions to be raised in one part of the program and caught and handled in another part. This helps to separate error handling logic from the main flow of the program, improving code modularity and readability.\n",
