    "No, the assignment operator += is not just for show; it serves a practical purpose in Python and can indeed lead to faster results at runtime in certain situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using += can lead to faster results at runtime in some cases, particularly when dealing with mutable data structures like lists and dictionaries. This is because += modifies the existing object in place, rather than creating a new object for the result of the operation.\n",

    "In this example, both approaches achieve the same result of extending my_list with elements from 0 to 999. However, the += approach modifies my_list in place, while the append() method creates a new list each time it's called and then appends it to my_list. As a result, using += may be faster in this scenario because it avoids the overhead of creating new list objects."
