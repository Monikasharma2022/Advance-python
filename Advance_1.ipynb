    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: OOP allows bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into objects.\n",
    "# This encapsulation helps in keeping the code organized and reduces complexity by hiding the internal implementation\n",
    "# details of an object from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: OOP provides the ability to define abstract classes and methods, allowing developers to create interfaces\n",
    "# that specify the behavior of objects without providing the implementation details. This promotes code reusability and \n",
    "# modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance: OOP supports the concept of inheritance, where a new class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods\n",
    "# from an existing class (superclass). This facilitates code reuse and allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships\n",
    "# between classes, promoting extensibility and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: OOP enables polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common\n",
    "# superclass. This allows for flexibility in programming and enables the same interface to be used for different types of objects,\n",
    "# simplifying code and promoting flexibility.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Python, when an attribute is accessed on an object instance using dot notation (e.g., object.attribute), Python searches for\n",
    "the attribute following the method resolution order (MRO). The MRO defines the sequence in which Python looks for attributes\n",
    "and methods in a class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to compute the MRO, which is based on the class's inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "It ensures that the search for attributes and methods proceeds in a consistent and predictable order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Python searches for attributes in the following order:\n",
