    "Readability and Maintainability: Named groups make the regular expression easier to understand because the names convey the purpose of each group. This improves readability, especially for complex patterns or patterns maintained by multiple developers. With named groups, it's clear what each group represents without needing to count or remember group numbers.\n",

By giving meaningful names to groups, you provide context and documentation directly within the pattern itself. This can help other developers (or even your future self) understand the purpose of each group without additional comments or external documentation.\n",
    "Avoidance of Group Number Changes: When you modify a regular expression by adding or removing groups, referring to groups by number can lead to errors if the group numbering changes. Named groups eliminate this risk because they're identified by their names rather than their positions. Even if you modify the pattern and reorder or add/remove groups, as long as the names remain consistent, the references to those groups will remain valid.\n",
    "Improved Code Robustness: Named groups make your code more robust to changes in the regular expression pattern. If you need to make modifications to the pattern in the future, using named groups reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs related to group references. This is particularly valuable in large codebases or when working on projects with frequent updates.\n",
    "Better Integration with Libraries and Tools: Many programming languages and libraries support accessing captured groups by name directly, which simplifies post-processing tasks. For example, in Python's re module, you can access named groups using the groupdict() method, which returns a dictionary of captured groups indexed by their names. This integration makes working with named groups seamless and efficient."
