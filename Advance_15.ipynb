    "Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the key features added in Python 3.8 include:\n",
    "Assignment Expressions (the Walrus Operator): The introduction of the assignment expression operator (:=), also known as the \"walrus operator,\" allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. For example:\n",

    "    Positional-Only Parameters: Function parameters can now be designated as positional-only by placing a / character in the function definition. This means that the parameters before the / can only be passed by position and not by keyword.\n",
    "f-strings Support \"=\" specifier: Python f-strings gained a new = specifier that causes the result to be formatted with the repr() of the expression. This can be useful for debugging purposes.\n",

    "Syntax Warning for Unreachable Code: Python 3.8 introduces a new SyntaxWarning for when it detects unreachable code.\n",

    "Other Improvements: Other improvements in Python 3.8 include a new math.prod() function for calculating the product of a sequence of numbers, the importlib.metadata module for reading metadata from installed distributions, and various library improvements and updates."

    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending code at runtime, typically by modifying attributes or methods of classes or modules.\n",

    "def greet():\n",
