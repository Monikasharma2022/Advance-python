    "# Attaching context information to exception artifacts can be crucial for debugging and understanding the cause of errors in a program. Here are two common methods for attaching context information to exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Custom Exception Classes with Context Parameters:\n",
    "# One approach is to create custom exception classes that accept additional context information as parameters during initialization. This context information can provide details about the state of the program when the exception occurred. Here's an example:\n",
    "# class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "#     def __init__(self, message, context=None):\n",
    "#         super().__init__(message)\n",
    "#         self.context = context\n",

    "# try:\n",
    "#     # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "#     pass\n",

    "#     # Attach context information to the exception\n",
    "#     raise CustomError(\"An error occurred\", context={\"variable\": x, \"line_number\": 42}) from e\n",
    "# In this example, when an exception is caught, a CustomError is raised with an additional context parameter containing relevant information such as variable values or line numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the with_traceback() Method:\n",

    "#     # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "#     pass\n",

    "# In Python, you can specify the text of an exception object's error message in various ways to provide meaningful information about the error. Here are two common methods for specifying the error message text:\n",
    "# Directly Passing Error Message to Exception Class:\n",
    "# One straightforward method is to directly pass the error message as an argument when raising an exception. This allows you to customize the error message based on the specific situation where the exception is raised. Here's an example:\n",

    "# raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: the value must be positive\")\n",
    "# In this example, the ValueError exception is raised with the specified error message \"Invalid input: the value must be positive\". This method is simple and concise, making it easy to communicate the reason for the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Formatting Error Message using String Formatting or f-strings:\n",
    "# Another method is to format the error message dynamically using string formatting techniques or f-strings. This allows you to include variable values or other context information within the error message. Here's an example using string formatting:\n",
    "# # Define variables\n",
    "# value = -5\n",
    "# # Raise an exception with a formatted error message\n",
    "# raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: the value '{}' is not positive\".format(value))\n",

    "# raise ValueError(f\"Invalid input: the value '{value}' is not positive\")\n",

    "# String-based exceptions, where you raise an exception by passing a string message instead of an exception object, have largely fallen out of favor in modern Python programming. There are several reasons for this:\n",
    "# Lack of Information: String-based exceptions provide limited information about the type of error that occurred. When you catch such an exception, you can't easily distinguish between different types of errors based on the exception type. This makes it harder to handle errors appropriately and can lead to less robust error handling.\n",
    "# No Stack Trace: String-based exceptions do not capture stack trace information by default. Stack trace information is crucial for debugging as it provides a traceback of function calls leading up to the error, helping developers identify the root cause of the problem. Without this information, it becomes more challenging to diagnose and fix errors.\n",
    "# Not Compatible with Exception Hierarchy: Python's exception hierarchy allows for organizing exceptions in a meaningful way, with built-in exception classes like ValueError, TypeError, etc. Using string-based exceptions bypasses this hierarchy, leading to inconsistency and difficulty in organizing and handling exceptions in a systematic manner.\n",
    "# Readability and Maintainability: Exception objects provide a clear and standardized way of raising and handling errors in Python code. Using string-based exceptions can make the code less readable and maintainable, as it deviates from common coding practices and conventions.\n",

In Python 3, raising exceptions with string messages is discouraged, and in Python 3.0, string-based exceptions were removed altogether."
